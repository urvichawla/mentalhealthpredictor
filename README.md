Our Mental Health Predictor is a pioneering project aimed at understanding the intricate relationship between social media usage and mental health. Through comprehensive data collection via Google Forms, we gather a diverse range of responses reflecting individuals' behaviors and sentiments towards social media platforms. Applying advanced machine learning algorithms, our predictor delves deep into this data pool to uncover patterns and correlations that shed light on mental health dynamics.

By employing various ML models, including  random forest classification logistic regression, KNN classification and clustering techniques, we decode the complex interplay between social media engagement and mental well-being. Our tool not only identifies potential risk factors but also highlights positive influences, offering actionable insights for individuals, mental health practitioners, and policymakers alike.
